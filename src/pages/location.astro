      <p>
        You'll find us right here at <strong>Woodland Lakes in Sullivan, Missouri</strong>, just a
        short drive from the natural beauty of <strong>Meramec State Park</strong>, <strong
          >Onondaga Cave State Park</strong
        >, and the <strong>Mark Twain National Forest</strong>. Whether you're a resident of the
        Woodland Lakes community or visiting from out of town, we're easy to get toâ€”<strong
          >with access from both inside the gates and from the main road</strong
        >. Just look for the signs and the smell of burgers on the grill. Whether you're coming to
        grab a bite, stock up on supplies, or check out our steel buildings, we're always glad to
        see you. Plug us into your GPS, and we'll have the coffee hot when you get here!
